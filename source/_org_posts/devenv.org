#+title: Working with devenv on a basic Python project
#+author: Sammy Al Hashemi

My friends and I have been working on a basic personal python project. During initial project setup, as I have been experimenting with nix, I decided to give ~devenv.sh~ a try.

* What it is
    - devenv makes it possible to create declarative dev environments that are reproducible between machines.
    - It works using ~nix~ as the declarative language.
    - You can specify packages to install, shell dependencies that you want in your dev environment, run scripts on shell startup, and run services crucial to your development in the background.
